    I have completed my third year of university and have started working on my fourth year.
    My first semester I completed Introduction to Information Security, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Principles of Programming Languages, and Operating Systems.
    I have been working on creating a good portofolio of projects and have been working on a few open-source projects.
    I also really enjoyed my second semester courses in Machine Learning and Image understanding. For my Image understanding course, I worked on a project that used a convolutional neural network to segment images as well.
    I also worked on a project that Neural Radiance Fields to construct 3D models from 2D images.
